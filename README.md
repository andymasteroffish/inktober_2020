Plotter drawings and source code by Andy Wallace for Inktober 2020

Each folder contains the oF source code, a few pics, and the G-code file for the print.

All code written in openFrameworks 0.11.0 and plotted using an AxidDraw V3

G-code generated with my ofxGCode library: https://github.com/andymasteroffish/ofxGCode
(which you are free to use for your own projects, but which is not fully tested)

G-code read by the Axidraw using my axidraw_gcode_ready python app: https://github.com/andymasteroffish/axidraw_gcode_reader
(One again, you're free to use it, but it's pretty idiosyncratic)
